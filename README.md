# OSL Shaders
A collection of OSL shaders useful for all kinds of things.
They have been written in 3DS MAX and verified to be renderable with Arnold before upload.

The shaders are hybrids of various initiatives.
Made available here so you can sit and play and experiment with procedural shader constructs.

If nothing else is explicitly described in the shaders, they are automatically Creative commons 3.0 share-a-like licenses.
Some shaders are conveted from shadertoy, some modified, some come from GLSLSandbox and some has been written from the ground up.

Let me know if there are any license/credit issues, because some of the code I cant even remember where came from.
Im not here to steal your work, I just train and in some cases, original sources are not available.
