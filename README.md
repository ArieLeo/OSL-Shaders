# OSL Shaders
A collection of OSL shaders useful for all kinds of things.
They have been written in 3DS MAX and verified to be renderable with Arnold before upload.

The shaders are hybrids of various initiatives.
Made available here so you can sit and play and experiment with procedural shader constructs.
