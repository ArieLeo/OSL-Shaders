# OSL Shaders
A collection of OSL shaders useful for all kinds of things.
They have been written in 3DS MAX and verified to be renderable with Arnold before upload.

The shaders are hybrids of various initiatives.
Made available here so you can sit and play and experiment with procedural shader constructs.

***CC3.0**** license info in shaders means:

Anything without license falls back to this license as well.

Some shaders are conveted from shadertoy, some modified, some come from GLSLSandbox and some has been written from the ground up.

Let me know if there are any license/credit issues, because some of the code I cant even remember where came from.
I just train and in some cases, original sources are not available.
You can contact me at gkmotu @ gmail dot com if you have any issues and I will attempt to streamline request the best I can! :)
